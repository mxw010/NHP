# AAV Capsids Alignment and Analysis

## Sciatic Nerve

### Alignment

- Finding sequences that matches the (truncated) upstream-7{NNK}-downstream pattern, for both forward and reverse stands.
- Only retain NNK repeats starting at 40bp (forward strand) and 115bp (reverse strand).
- Only retain NNK repeats that are in agreement between R1 and R2.
- Only retain NNK repeats that have quality score > 30.
- Translate DNA sequences into Peptides and remove peptides with stop codons.
